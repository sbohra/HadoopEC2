********Setup for multi-node Hadoop cluster on Amazon EC2************

Total of four nodes 
---->NameNode
---->SlaveNode1
---->SlaveNode2
---->Secondary NameNode
Firstly need to create the Amazon Free-trail account 

Setting the Amazon Aws Instances:
---->Once you have signed up for Amazon account. Login to Amazon Web Services, click on My Account and navigate to Amazon EC2 Console.
---->Click on "Launch instance" Button.
---->Choose Ubuntu Server 64-bit OS.
---->Select the micro instance(Amazon EC2 provides different instance types, these have varying combinations of CPUS, Memory, Storage and Network Capacity).
---->Configure the number of instances, which in this case is four.
---->Add minimum storage to 8 GB.
---->Create a new security group, later on we are going to modify the security group with security rules.
     The default is “SSH” and 0.0.0.0/0. This means that any computer can connect to your instance over ssh. 
     In practice, you would assign a restricted list of IP addresses that can access your cluster. 
---->Launch instances and create Security pair. Amazon EC2 uses public–key cryptography to encrypt and decrypt login information. 
     Public–key cryptography uses a public key to encrypt a piece of data, such as a password, then the recipient uses the private key to decrypt the data. 
	 The public and private keys are known as a key pair.
---->Create a new key pair and give it a name “hadoopec2cluster” and download the key pair (.pem) file to your local machine. Click Launch Instance
Now after launching the instances we can Rename them with NameNode, SecondaryNode, SlaveNode1 and SlaveNode2.(Note: we can note the IP addresses so that we can use
them with Putty later to connect Instances.
In order to have TCP and ICMP access we need to add 2 additional security rules. Add TCP,ICMP and SSH(22) under the inbound rules to “HadoopEC2SecurityGroup.

Putty for Connecting four Instances :  
Here we will use putty(Windows) to connects with Namenode instance and we will set-up passwordless ssh, so that Master node can communicate with the slave nodes.
we will also make use of PuttyGen Client and downloaded hadoopec2cluster.pem file to generate the private key (.ppk). 
Using PuttyGen import key pair, which created during lunching the instances and save the private key with meaningful name.
Now connect to Namenode with Putty, import the .ppk private key for user name Ubuntu and also five the Hostname and port 22. similarly, connect to slave1 and slave2.

Enable Public Access:
Issue ifconfig command and note down the ip address. Next, we are going to update the hostname with ec2 public URL.
finally we are going to update /etc/hosts file to map  the ec2 public URL with ip address.
This will help us to configure master ans slaves nodes with hostname instead of ip address.
Now, issue the hostname command, it will display the ip address same as inet address from ifconfig command.

Modify etc/hosts file:
Open the /etc/hosts in vi editor, in a very first line it will show 127.0.0.1 localhost, 
we need to replace that with amazon ec2 hostname and ip address we just collected and save it.
similarly add the other three instances IP address and hostnames in the next line.

WinSCP for transferring files from windows to Namenode:
Now use winSCP for transferring the files securely from windows to Namenode instance on AWS server, for this all you need to do is enter Hostname of Namenode
instance, username as ubuntu and under Advance options insert the private key which save earlier. Namenode will use this .ppk file to connect to slaves.
